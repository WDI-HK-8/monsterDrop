WDI HK 8 project 1

### Before we go into the game

- Vertical lines are called columns  
- Horizontal lines are called branches  
- player can choose who to play against (computer, another player or oneself) 
- There are 3 matches to a game  
- Players' goals and role swaps every match 


#### Now. The Game MonsterDrop
**Player 1**  
- In the 1st match, Player 1 will be the **the Protector**  
- Within 20 seconds, P1 sets up a number of branches in between the 5 columns (5 columns is a game default) AND;  
- position of his PIG at the bottom of the maze  
- Once the maze is set up, P1 press the button to confirm    
- Goal is to protect the pig from getting eaten by the monster, to be unleashed by Player 2  

**Player 2**  
- Player 2 will be **Predator** in the 1st match  
- Within 10 seconds, through anaylsing the maze, P2 will decide which column to place the monster.  
- Monster will start from the top and make its way to the bottom.  
- Monster will cross the branch whenever its sees one. Because the Monster is left handed, he will always choose left (your right) first before going right (your left).
- if monster meets the pig, monster will shred the pig into bacon, P1 loses. If otherwise P1, wins.
